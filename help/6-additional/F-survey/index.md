You can create surveys to get feedback from your students!
  1. GOTO: **Surveys** (Sidebar) > **+**
  2. Fill in the details

It should then bring you to this page:

You can create **Sections** to modularize your questions:

After creating your sections, you can add questions to each section! There are 3 types of questions:
  1. Text Response
  2. MCQs
  3. MRQs

If you notice, it is very similar to how such questions are created in assessments!

Once you're done creating your survey, remember to **publish** it!

Additionally, you can view the statistics for the survey with respect to:
  1. Responses (the students who responded/did not respond)
  2. Results (statistics for the answers of each question)
