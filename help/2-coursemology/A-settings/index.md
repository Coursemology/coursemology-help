Once one of your colleagues is an administrator for your Coursemology instance, he/she can upgrade your role to an instructor.
The admin has full-access to the Coursemology instance, whereas Instructors can only create a new course.
Take note of any RED buttons in the 'Instance Administration Panel' as they are irreversible!


To view users and courses in your Coursemology instance:
  * GOTO: **"Username" > Instance Administration Panel > Users**
  * GOTO: **"Username" > Instance Administration Panel > Courses**

To upgrade your other users to an Instructor:
  1. GOTO: **"Your Name" > Instance Administration Panel > Users**
  2. Change to role of the user to **Instructor** and click the blue check box.
  3. There should be a notification confirming that the user was updated.
