Once one of your colleagues is an administrator for your Coursemology instance, he/she can upgrade your role to an instructor.
The admin has full-access to the Coursemology instance, whereas Instructors can only create a new course.
Take note of any RED buttons in the 'Instance Administration Panel' as they are irreversible!


To view users and courses in your Coursemology instance:
	1) GOTO: "Username" > Instance Administration Panel > Users
	2) GOTO: "Username" > Instance Administration Panel > Courses

To upgrade your other users to an Instructor:
	1) "Your Name" > Instance Administration Panel > Users
	2) Change to role of the user to "Instructor" and click the blue check box.
	3) There should be a notification confirming that the user was updated.
